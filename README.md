# Porfolio Website For Reggie Mosley

## Description

This website was created to demonstrate my value and skill as a full-stack developer. 

It is a place for potential employers to learn more about me, and my past projects, as well as track my developing skillset. 

It also serves to direct them towards my contact information on various platforms.

While I am rather low-profile by nature, this is my attempt to sell myself as a value contributor to a web and software development team.
